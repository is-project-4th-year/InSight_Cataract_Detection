### Project Overview  
**InSight** is a mobile application designed to assist in the early detection of cataracts through image-based classification powered by a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system aims to offer accessible and offline diagnostic support for low-resource settings using an Android app built with **Kivy** and **TensorFlow Lite**.

### Objectives  
- Develop a lightweight CNN model to classify eye images as cataract-positive or negative.  
- Deploy the model on an Android app for offline usage.  
- Offer a user-friendly and affordable screening tool to support healthcare outreach.

### Key Features  
- Offline cataract detection via pre-trained ML model  
- Simple UI/UX for quick eye image capture and prediction  
- Potential for expansion to support other retinal conditions  

### Methodology  
- Experimental Machine Learning Paradigm  
- Dataset preprocessing, augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow  
- Model optimization and conversion to `.tflite` for mobile deployment  
- Interface development using Kivy framework  

### Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, Kivy  
- **Design Tools**: Figma (for UI wireframes)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **Others**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  

### Status  
Project initialization phase — setting up base folders, environment and documentation. Model prototyping and dataset testing will follow.
